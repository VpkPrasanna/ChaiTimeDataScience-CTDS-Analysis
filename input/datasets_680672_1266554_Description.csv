Correction: Apologies and correction: Zach is a student at the University of West Florida, not university of Washington 

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews his peer from the fast.ai community: Zachary Mueller, who's a student at the University of West Florida, currently pursuing his bachelor's degree in software design and development. 

In this interview they talk all about fast.ai the course and fast.ai V2 the upcoming library along with all about Zach's experience with fast.ai, his journey into deep learning and fast.ai, and the projects that he's built while going through the course. 

They also talked about a study group that Zach has now been running for a few weeks, that builds on top of fast.ai V2 the new library on which the course is yet to come out. 

They also talked a lot about the top down learning approach and how can you go about learning fast.ai.

Personal Note: I think this is one of the most honest, and the best interviews in terms of the transparent Kaggle, learning to learn, and how to approach machine learning problems or machine learning materials advice. 

Radek shares his journey with complete honesty about how he went about learning the fast.ai materials, how he went on to smashing the kaggle competitions that he participated in, and his journey on learning to learn about all of the materials fast.ai and beyond in the machine learning world. 

They also talk a lot about learning to learn fast ai, and Kaggle all three together and individually as well.

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews one of the inspirations for the complete Machine Learning Community: Dr. Erin Ledell, chief machine learning scientist at H2O.ai. 

Erin holds a PhD from UC Berkeley where her research was focused on machine learning and computational stats, and she has worked in the software industry before joining H2O. 

They talk all about her journey into the field into starts machine learning and her journey at H2O along with h2o's open source products, h2o-auto ML.

Erin clarifies the question of the difference between h2o, h2o-3 and h2o auto ML, so please stay tuned if you're curious to find out the answer to that. 

They discuss about her work at h2o.ai and Erin shares many great advisors and opinions about auto ML and software or software tools for data scientists or humans generally speaking, 

Erin is the (co)-founder of Rladies and women in machine learning and data science. They talk about her contributions to the community and how can  outsiders or just newcomers contribute to this.

They talk all about Mark's journey into machine learning: 

How he got interested in machine learning? How did he discover Kaggle? His addiction for Kaggle? How his approach on Kaggle has evolved over all of these years that he's been active on the platform?

They talked about his journey at h2o: he's been at h2o.ai for a few years now. They also talk about auto ML, we reveal interesting story: AutoML at h2o.ai was originally called AutoMarkLandry. And there's a lot of discussion around data science on and off Kaggle, how to approach Kaggle or data science problems. 

This one is all about data science, Kaggle, and h2o.ai but it's true to the three words, they talk all about these three words and Mark's journey in all of these three.

They dive into the three aspects on Goku's personal profile: #AI research. Health Care and #Education 

They start by talking about Goku's journey into research how he got interested into machine learning. He shares many amazing advices for future aspiring researchers, followed by healthcare and machine learning. 

Education: Goku has recently started madewithmachinelearning.com his latest contribution to education machine learning education, Made with ML is a platform for discovering projects. organising projects and building projects, sharing them with the community. We really dive deep into what the platform is the philosophy behind it, and the future of it, and many upcoming features. Most of these would have been integrated by the time this interview goes out. So please do sign up if you get a chance.

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews Emmanuel Ameisen, ML engineer at Stripe, and the author of the O'Reilly book: ""Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from idea to product""

In this interview they talk about Emmanuel's journey into machine learning, and how his journey through the different roles led him to writing the book.

The book is one of the greatest resources for the title for Building ML Apps, and also one of the greatest top down learning books that follow the top down teaching approach.

They talk about who the book is a really for, what can you expect out of it and Emanuel's journey of writing to Book and where to go after you've read the book, How do you find your idea to take to project your passion project or your million dollar app idea.

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews Kaggle Grandmaster and Data Scientist at H2O.ai: Yauhen Babakhin.

They talk about Yauhen's roots in Belarus and some secrets of his and his approaches to Kaggle competition and his approach to auto ML. 

They discuss a lot about how Yauhen approach these problems, how he finds ideas and how he iterated upon them. They also covered an interesting area that Yauhen has contributed to via Kaggle which is academia.

Note: Correction: At 7:35: Heads or Tails' Kaggle avatar is the spiral galaxy M101, which has the nickname 'Pinwheel galaxy', not 'Whirlpool galaxy' 

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews the First #Kernel #GrandMaster on #Kaggle: ""Heads or Tails"": Martin Henze. 

In this interview, they talk about his journey into data science, his transition from astronomy, astronomy involves a lot of looking up to the skies and trying to figure out through data what's out there, and as you might imagine, many parallels are drawn between astronomy and data science and Martin's approach to creating the amazing kernels. 

They also discuss his transition into doing data science during the day. 

Personal Note: There are a lot of rich hidden golden advices for people that are working towards sharing their kernels on Kaggle.

Personal Note: It was really a privilege to talk to Andreas on the show, thanks to @Abhishek Thakur for helping make this happen. 

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews one of the core developers at Scikit-Learn: @Andreas Mueller 

This episode is all about open source and machine learning, They talked about how Andreas' overview about open source and machine learning and Scikit-Learn itself has evolved over the years how his approach to creating open source API's, his understanding of open source has evolved over the years that he's been active in the open source community. 

There's a lot of discussion around scikit learn and learning through materials and Andreas' take on the recent developments in deep learning.

We also discuss Andreas' move back to Industry, he'll be joining Microsoft and this interview talks about what's next for him as well.

Personal Note: A huge thanks to the community for the support with the interview series. This is my 100th interview, it's an honour and the 100th interview had to be with my guru, Dr. Rachel Thomas

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews co-founder of fast.ai and Director, USF Center for Applied Data Ethics. 


This episode covers three broad themes: They talk about top down learning, and what does it take to create a course or material that follows the top down deep teaching approach, as well as ethics and biases. 

Rachel answers the question of how can we do better? How can we address this theme better? 

They also discuss project building and blogging. This episode really addresses a few very important topics and we hope you all get to learn about Ethics, specially Ethics applied in AI.
